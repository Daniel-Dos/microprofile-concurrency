/**
 * <p>A container-managed executor service that creates instances of CompletableFuture,
 * which it backs as the default asynchronous execution facility, both for the
 * CompletableFuture itself as well as all dependent stages created from it,
 * as well as all dependent stages created from those, and so on.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * <code>&commat;Inject</code> ManagedExecutor executor;
 * ...
 * CompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; future = executor
 *    .supplyAsync(supplier)
 *    .thenApplyAsync(function1)
 *    .thenApply(function2)
 *    ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This specification allows for managed executors that do not capture and propagate thread context,
 * which can offer better performance. If thread context propagation is desired only for specific stages,
 * the <code>ThreadContext.contextual*</code> API methods can be used to propagate thread context to
 * individual actions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example of single action with context propagation:</p>
 * <pre>
 * CompletableFuture&lt;?&gt; future = executor
 *    .runAsync(runnable1)
 *    .thenRun(threadContext.contextualRunnable(runnable2))
 *    .thenRunAsync(runnable3)
 *    ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For managed executors that are defined as capturing and propagating thread context,
 * it must be done in a consistent manner. Thread context is captured from the thread that creates
 * a completion stage and is applied to the thread that runs the action, being removed afterward.
 * When dependent stages are created from the completion stage, and likewise from any dependent stages
 * created from those, and so on, thread context is captured from the thread that creates the dependent
 * stage. This guarantees that the action performed by each stage always runs under the thread context
 * of the code that creates the stage. When applied to the ExecutorService methods,
 * <code>execute</code>, <code>invokeAll</code>, <code>invokeAny</code>, <code>submit</code>,
 * thread context is captured from the thread invoking the request and propagated to thread that runs
 * the task, being removed afterward.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface is intentionally kept compatible with ManagedExecutorService,
 * with the hope that its methods might one day be contributed to that specification.</p>
 *
 * <p>Managed executors are managed by the container, not be the user. Therefore, all
 * life cycle methods must raise IllegalStateException. This includes:
 * awaitTermination, isShutdown, isTerminated, shutdown, shutdownNow</p>
