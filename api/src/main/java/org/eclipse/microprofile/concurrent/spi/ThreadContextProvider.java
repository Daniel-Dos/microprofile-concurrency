 * <p>The <code>ThreadContextProvider</code> implementation and related classes are

 * discoverable via the standard <code>ServiceLoader</code> mechanism. The JAR file
 * that packages it must include a file of the following name and location,</p>
 *
 * <code>META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.concurrent.spi.ThreadContextProvider</code>
 *
 * <p>The content of the aforementioned file must be one or more lines, each specifying
 * the fully qualified name of a <code>ThreadContextProvider</code> implementation
 * that is provided within the JAR file.</p>
 *
 * <p><code>ManagedExecutor</code> and <code>ThreadContext</code> must use the
 * <code>ServiceLoader</code> to identify all available implementations of
 * <code>ThreadContextProvider</code> that can participate in thread context capture
 * & propagation and must invoke them either to capture current thread context or establish
 * default thread context per the configuration of the <code>ManagedExecutor</code> or
 * <code>ThreadContext</code> instance wherever these interfaces are used to create
